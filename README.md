1 client.py explanation :

import socket and import time: These are Python modules that are imported to use socket programming and handle time-related functions.

HOST and PORT: These constants define the IP address and port number the client will use to connect to the server.

def client(): This is the main function that represents the client's behavior.

Inside the client() function:

It establishes a connection to the server using a socket created with the AF_INET and SOCK_STREAM parameters.
It enters a loop where the client can input commands such as 'ping', 'get_time', or 'exit'.
If 'exit' is entered, the client exits the loop and the program terminates.
For other commands, it measures the round-trip time (RTT) by recording the time before sending the message and after receiving a response.
It sends the command to the server, receives a response, and calculates the RTT.
It prints the received data and the RTT in seconds.
if __name__ == '__main__': ensures that the client() function is executed when the script is run.

2. server.py explnation

import socket and import threading: These Python modules are imported to perform socket programming and handle multithreading.

HOST and PORT: These constants define the IP address and port number on which the server will listen for incoming connections.

def handle_client(client_socket): This function handles a client's connection once established.

It enters a loop, receiving data from the client.
It decodes the received data to interpret the client's command.
If the command is "ping," it responds with "pong." If the command is "get_time," it sends the server's current time. Otherwise, it sends "Unknown command."
The loop continues until no more data is received, and the client socket is then closed.
def server(): This is the main function that represents the server's behavior.

It creates a socket using AF_INET and SOCK_STREAM, binds it to the defined HOST and PORT, and listens for incoming connections.
It enters a loop where it waits for client connections.
When a client connects, a new thread is created (using threading) to handle that client independently.
The server continues to listen for more connections.
if __name__ == '__main__': ensures that the server() function is executed when the script is run.
